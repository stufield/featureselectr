\description{
This is a S3 method that sets up the internal functions for
the cross-validation. Since these are internal only methods,
documentation will be minimal.

The \emph{stratified} version is a S3 method that sets up the
internal functions for the cross-validation for stratified folds.
Stratified implies that the internal structure of the response
variable is maintained (e.g. the proportion of disease samples in the
fold is comparable to the disease proportion in the full training set).

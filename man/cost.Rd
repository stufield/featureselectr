\usage{
cost(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{feature_select} class object.}
}
\value{
A metric, a numeric value, to be optimized depending
on the type, one of:
\item{}{Area Under the Curve (AUC), max}
\item{}{Correspondence Correlation Coefficient (CCC), max}
\item{}{Mean Squared Error (MSE), min}
\item{}{R-squared (R2), max}
\item{}{Sensitivity + Specificity, max}
}
\description{
The Feature Selection framework provides for generic cost functions to be
defined. This S3 method allows for model fit/cost to be calculated for
appropriately structured objects and requires an input object that is
structured appropriately.
This functionality is performed internally within the feature selection
algorithm and is unlikely to require direct user calls.
